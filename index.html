      <p>Hello, I am Diego Fernandez, an up and coming UX/UI Designer. I recently graduated from UTSA and am looking at an opportunity to grow my skills. I am passionate about my work and am always looking to learn new skills and looking for ways to collaborate with others. I enjoy solving user problems and creating prototyping. My skills include user research and usability testing as well as collaboration and prototyping. What makes me unique is my creativity and my passion for wanting to be the best. I am from San Antonio, TX and would ideally want to work for a company that can help me hone my skills and continue to develop as a UX/UI designer.</p>

          <div class="skillImage"></div><img src="images/image 8.png" width="200px">
          <p>I have a strong understanding of user research and the process it takes to make if effective. I am an effective communicator both verbally and in writing and am able to run usability tests effectively in a one on one setting or virtual setting. I am able to know which tests to run and am effective in understanding who the user is.</p>

            <div class="skillImage"><img src="images/image 5.png" width="200px">
            <p> I am good at focusing prioritizing page elements based on user needs to make the wireframing the best it can be. I am also skilled at prototyping at multiple levels and making sure it is done well to be able to run tests and gather effective feedback needed in order to improve the prototype.</p>

            <p>I am skilled at effectively organizing and structuring content whether it be through a presentation, a prototype, or a usability testing. I make it easier for the user to find where they are, locate relative information needed, find where they need to go and whats next. I am also skilled at working on projects with very bad information architecture and finding the important and relevant information.</p>

                <h2>Travel App</h2>
                <p>This was the first project that I worked on solo. It was a app that I created to help travelers stay safe when going out of the country. The app would give the user useful information in that country as far as important phone numbers, an warnings that were important and tips for travling safely. It would give the user emergeny and non emergency numbers for the country they were going to and even break it down by country or city.</p>

                <h2>Project Stay Redesign</h2>
                <p>This was the second group project that I did. It was a redesign of a non profit organzation. We were tasked with making the website fit more with the users that would it. For this project, I worked on the mobile redesign of the website and worked on making the information architecture more relevant and easier to locate the information that the user would need as well as make the design more modern since the original website was very outdated.  </p>

                <p>This was the first group project that I did. We were tasked with creating an app that would improve the lives of people. My group and I decided to create an app that would aim at reducing food waste and therefore help people save money and eat healthier. For this project, I worked on the interview plan and ran some of the interviews, came up with the team and app name, did wireframing, and helped along with all the user research steps.</p>
